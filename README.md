# Bangla Quotes Classification – Comparative Analysis

This project focuses on classifying Bangla quotes into multiple categories using both classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. The goal is to compare the performance of traditional approaches (like Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) with advanced neural architectures (like LSTM and Bi-LSTM) for multiclass text classification in the Bangla language.

## Overview

- **Dataset**: Bangla Quotes Dataset (preprocessed and cleaned for classification tasks).
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**
  - **Logistic Regression (LR)**
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
  - **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)**

### Objective
The main objective is to compare the accuracy and performance metrics across these algorithms to determine the best-suited model for Bangla text classification.

## Methodology

### Preprocessing
- Tokenization and stopword removal for Bangla text.
- Text-to-sequence conversion with padding for deep learning models.

### Models Implemented
- **MNB & LR**: Trained on TF-IDF features.
- **LSTM & Bi-LSTM**: Trained on word embeddings with sequence input.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Accuracy**

## Results

### Table II: Accuracy table for multiclass classification

| Algorithm                             | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy  |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)         | 0.5860    | 0.6264 | 0.5900   | 62.65%    |
| Logistic Regression (LR)              | 0.6317    | 0.6706 | 0.6358   | 67.06%    |
| Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)         | 0.9212    | 0.9283 | 0.9212   | 92.84%    |
| Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)          | 0.9493    | 0.9462 | 0.9434   | 94.63%    |

### Observations:
- Traditional ML algorithms (MNB, LR) perform moderately.
- Deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM) show significant improvement, with **Bi-LSTM** outperforming all in every metric.

## Conclusion

- **Bi-LSTM** is the most effective approach for Bangla Quotes classification, achieving 94.63% accuracy.
- This highlights the advantage of deep contextual representation for Bangla text.

Future work can focus on exploring transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, mBERT, BanglaBERT) for further improvements.
